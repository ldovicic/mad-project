Project Proposal

Analysis of the used car market
Lubos Dovicic, 2DAV

Not all cars are made the same and the price usually reflects that. I want to examine the key factors that drive the price of used vehicles, whether that be the car's make, model year or other factors. Then, I'd like to further analyze which models retain their value longer or shorter than the average, as certain models are still in demand many years later. The current hypothesis is that popular vehicle makes in Slovakia (Skoda, etc.) will be in demand more due to the availability of spare parts.

This analysis could be divided into these parts:
- obtaining the data (scraping the data from used car online markets)
- filtering out unnecessary and faulty data
- analyzing the data for any correlations
- forming conclusions

The main goals are:
- find out which factors influence the price the most
- find out which models retain their value the best
- (optional, depending on the time requirement of the previous tasks) compare the results to new car offers
- (also optional) build a web application to display the data

The main source(s) will be:
https://www.autobazar.eu/

Technologies used:
- Python and relevant libraries
- (optional) Jupyter/Google Colab
- (optional) JS
- (optional) NodeJS
